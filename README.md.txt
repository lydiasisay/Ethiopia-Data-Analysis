# Analysis of Climate Impact on Food Security in Ethiopia

## Project Overview
This Python project analyzes the statistical relationship between annual rainfall patterns and food price inflation in Ethiopia. As a student in the top 5% of the Ethiopian national curriculum, I developed this tool to demonstrate the application of Data Science in addressing national economic challenges.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Statistical Logic:** Calculated Pearson Correlation to measure the link between variables.
* **Data Manipulation:** Used the **Pandas** library for structured data processing.
* **Data Visualization:** Generated plots using **Matplotlib** to visualize economic trends.

## Key Insights
The model demonstrates how climate variability directly correlates with market prices, providing a data-driven perspective on food security.
